## üöÄ Getting Started

### Files Included

1. **STL Files**:
    - `STL files\Raspi_case_body.stl`: 3D model of the main body of the Raspberry Pi case, designed to house and protect the Raspberry Pi 3.
    - `STL files\Raspi_cover.stl`: 3D model of the protective cover that snaps onto the case body.
    - `STL files\Raspi_screen_cover.stl` : 3D model of the cover to securely hold the 7-inch touchscreen
    - `STL files\Sunshade.STL` : 3D model of the sunshade designed to fit around the touchscreen.

### Materials Needed

- **Raspberry Pi 3**: Ideal for Android Auto setup with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB ports.
- **Official 7-Inch Raspberry Pi Touchscreen**: Easy-to-connect display with GPIO power.
- **MicroSD Card (16GB or more)**: For OS and Crankshaft installation.
- **USB Sound Card and External Microphone**: For audio output and voice commands.
- **12V to USB Adapter**: To power the setup via your car's cigarette lighter.
- **3D Printed Support**: Designed to hold the Pi and screen securely in the car.

### Hardware Setup

1. **Connect the Display**:
   - Attach the 7-inch touchscreen to the Raspberry Pi using the ribbon cable for display and GPIO pins for power.
   
2. **Audio Setup**:
   - Connect the USB sound card to the Pi and link the audio output to your car stereo using a 3.5mm jack cable.
   
3. **Power Supply**:
   - Use a 12V to USB adapter to power the Pi from your car‚Äôs cigarette lighter.

### Software Installation

1. **Download Crankshaft**:
   - [Crankshaft](https://getcrankshaft.com): A ready-to-use image for turning your Pi into an Android Auto head unit.

2. **Install Etcher**:
   - [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher): Use this tool to flash the Crankshaft image onto your microSD card.
 
3. **Configure Crankshaft**:
   - Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi. Crankshaft will auto-configure for your phone when connected.

### Customization Options

- **Sound Settings**: Adjust audio output levels and equalizer settings directly from the Crankshaft interface.
- **Screen Brightness**: Modify display brightness for optimal viewing under various lighting conditions.
- **Sleep Mode**: Manage power settings to conserve energy when the car is off.
- **Bluetooth & Wi-Fi**: Enable wireless connections to minimize cables inside your vehicle.

## üß∞ Installation in the Car

1. **3D Printed Mounting**:
   - Use custom 3D printed parts to securely mount the Raspberry Pi and screen on the dashboard.
   - Recommended 3D Printing Settings:
     - **Material**: PETG or ABS for high durability and resistance to temperature changes inside the car.
     - **Layer Height**: 0.2mm for a good compromise between speed and print quality.
     - **Infill**: 20-30% to provide sufficient strength while minimizing material use.

2. **Non-Invasive Setup**:
   - Utilize Velcro strips and cable ties to position the components without drilling or permanently altering the car.

3. **Cable Management**:
   - Keep cables organized and out of sight with cable clips and Velcro, maintaining a clean installation.
